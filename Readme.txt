Hey, this project is live at https://asifsyed.dev. This is my personal website which I use to showcase my work. You're free to use the sourcecode. I wont be charging you anything. Also, you don't need to give me any credits.
Want to know an interesting fact? I never paid for running this website. Everything is done on free/opensource platform. Details are given below:

Hosting
=========
This website is currently hosted in AWS EC2 (mumbai region). The instance being used is a T2-Micro. This instance is available for free for 1 complete year (just register, no questions asked!). Since this is a personal website, where I can expect very less traffic, hence, this instance is more than satidfactory.

SSL & Security
================
This website is being cloudflare security. The plan that is being used is Free plan (just register and verify). It provides a good security for basic website with nominal traffic, enough for my personal website. For SSL, I'm using Let's Encrypt X3 free certificates. Believe me when I say that this is more that enough for a website. Many re-nouned companies uses their service, and interestingly, majority of website of Govt. Of India is also using this provider.

Domain
========
Well I bought the domain from GoDaddy. This was purchased after I earned enough commissions from selling the pro services in GoDaddy.

Coding
========
I used visual studio community for the service. This webservice is also available for free for all developers, along with a host of other services.
